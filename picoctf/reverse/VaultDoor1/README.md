For this challenge we were given a java file.

AFter readin the file, we find that we are doing some checks on the password which is of the length of 32. Nothing hard again, i copied the password, and with some quick `:%s/.charAt/[/g` until I got a functioning array of chars, and then the only last step left is to print them.
