![Challenge Description](Screenshot_2023-04-20_15-12-30.png)

In the challenge, we were given a file named "flag" and were asked to find the flag given that it is stored in plain sight.
we run the "file" command on the flag

![file command](obedient_cat_file.png)

We see that it is an ASCII text.
There is a command called "strings" that extracts human readable characters from a file. We can run it:

![strings command](obedient_cat_flag.png)

And this is our flag.
